            is a <xref keyref="flowers.genus" format="dita">genus</xref> of about 250 species of
            flowering plants in the coffee family, <b>Rubiaceae</b>, native to the tropical and
            subtropical regions of Africa, southern Asia, Australasia and Oceania. Several species
            occur on Hawaii, where gardenias are known as <i>na'u</i> or <i>nanu</i>.</p>
        <p><image href="../../images/Gardeniaflower.jpg" id="img"/></p>
        <p>The genus was named by Carl Linnaeus after Dr. Alexander Garden (1730-1791), a
            Scottish-born American naturalist.</p>
        <p><b>Gardenia</b> plants are prized for the strong sweet scent of their flowers, which can
            be very large in some species.</p>
        <p id="p"><b>Gardenias</b> have a reputation for being difficult to grow. Because they
            originated in warm humid tropical areas, they demand high humidity to thrive. They
            flourish in acidic soils with good drainage and thrive on [68-74 F temperatures (20-23
            C)] during the day and 60 F (15-16 C) in the evening. Potting soils developed especially
            for gardenias are available.</p>

        <p>In Japan and China, <b>Gardenia jasminoides</b> is called <i>Kuchinashi</i> (Japanese)
            and <i>Zhi zi</i> (Chinese); the bloom is used as a yellow dye, which is used for
            clothes and food (including the Korean mung bean jelly called hwangpomuk).</p>
        <p><b>Gardenia</b><indexterm>flowers<indexterm>summer<indexterm>gardenia</indexterm></indexterm></indexterm>
            is a <xref keyref="flowers.genus" format="dita">genus</xref> of about 250 species of
            flowering plants in the coffee family, <b>Rubiaceae</b>, native to the tropical and
            subtropical regions of Africa, southern Asia, Australasia and Oceania. Several species
            occur on Hawaii, where gardenias are known as <i>na'u</i> or <i>nanu</i>.</p>
        <image conref="#topic-1/img"/>
        <p>The genus was named by Carl Linnaeus after Dr. Alexander Garden (1730-1791), a

        <p>In Japan and China, <b>Gardenia jasminoides</b> is called <i>Kuchinashi</i> (Japanese)
            and <i>Zhi zi</i> (Chinese); the bloom is used as a yellow dye, which is used for
            clothes and food (including the Korean mung bean jelly called hwangpomuk).</p>

            is a <xref keyref="flowers.genus" format="dita">genus</xref> of about 250 species of flowering
            plants in the coffee family, <b>Rubiaceae</b>, native to the tropical and subtropical
            regions of Africa, southern Asia, Australasia and Oceania. Several species occur on

        <p>The genus was named by Carl Linnaeus after Dr. Alexander Garden (1730-1791), a

        <p>In Japan and China, <b>Gardenia jasminoides</b> is called <i>Kuchinashi</i> (Japanese)
            and <i>Zhi zi</i> (Chinese); the bloom is used as a yellow dye, which is used for
            clothes and food (including the Korean mung bean jelly called hwangpomuk).</p>
        <p><b>Gardenia</b><indexterm>flowers<indexterm>summer<indexterm>gardenia</indexterm></indexterm></indexterm>
            is a <xref keyref="flowers.genus" format="dita">genus</xref> of about 250 species of flowering
            plants in the coffee family, <b>Rubiaceae</b>, native to the tropical and subtropical
            regions of Africa, southern Asia, Australasia and Oceania. Several species occur on
            Hawaii, where gardenias are known as <i>na'u</i> or <i>nanu</i>.</p>
        <image conref="#topic-1/img"/>
        <p>The genus was named by Carl Linnaeus after Dr. Alexander Garden (1730-1791), a
            Scottish-born American naturalist.</p>
        <p><b>Gardenia</b> plants are prized for the strong sweet scent of their flowers, which can
            be very large in some species.</p>
